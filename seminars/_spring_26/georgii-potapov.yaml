abstract: >
  E-variables are a relatively new approach for testing statistical hypotheses that has been experiencing major development during the last several years.
  We introduce the method of e-variable-approximability that can be used to develop a general approximation technique, allowing to construct e-variables for popular distribution classes important for applications.
  E-variables were originally based on a concept of Levin’s (average-bounded) randomness tests from Algorithmic Information Theory. 
  It turns out that construction of e-variables via e-variable approximability can be used to provide an explicit construction for a randomness test with respect to a class of distributions.
