  Luca Neri is a research fellow at UCLouvain. He obtained his PhD in Economics from Aarhus University and works on econometrics and time-series econometrics, with a focus on structural macroeconomic models, identification, and continuous-time methods.

abstract: >
  We develop a likelihood-based framework for estimating linearized continuous-time DSGE models from discrete-time data observed at mixed frequencies. An exact discrete-time state-space representation accommodates arbitrary combinations of stock and flow measurements without expanding the state vector. We characterize how impulse responses estimated from mixed-frequency data relate to their continuous-time model counterparts. Monte Carlo experiments using a New Keynesian model show that mixed-frequency estimation reduces bias and RMSE relative to common-frequency estimation, with gains arising from frequency mixing rather than from uniformly increasing the sampling rate.
