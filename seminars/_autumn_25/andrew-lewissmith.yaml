abstract: >
  Esteva and Godo's Monoidal T-Norm Logic (MTL) is a well-studied fuzzy and Substructural logic. It is primarily studied algebraically. In this seminar, we present recent results both semantic and proof-theoretic. We situate MTL amongst other Substructural and modal logics via Kripke semantics (using algebraic representation results of Zuluaga and Castiglioni), identifying the frames of MTL and axiomatic extensions thereof (Godel logic, BL, and so on). We also seek to grasp the computational interpretation of MTL, which has surprisingly received very little attention, and for which normalisation, cut-elimination, bidirectional translations exist using standard tools (contrasting with the situation for other mainstream fuzzy logics). The two problems are interrelated. Our work prefaces further work on the term-calculi for MTL, labelled calculi, and weaker subsystems of MTL (e.g. Intuitionistic linear logic with Pre-linearity)
